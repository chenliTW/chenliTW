/ Awash with unfocused desire, Everett    \

| ear and felt the presence of somebody   |
| else behind him, which caused terror to |
| push through his nervous system like a  |
| flash flood roaring down the mid-fork   |
| of the Feather River before the         |
| completion of the Oroville Dam in 1959. |
