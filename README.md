/ Delores breezed along the surface of    \
| her life like a flat stone forever      |
| skipping along smooth water, rippling   |
| reality sporadically but oblivious to   |
| it consistently, until she finally lost |
| momentum, sank, and due to an overdose  |
| of flouride as a child which caused her |
| to suffer from chronic apathy, doomed   |
| herself to lie forever on the floor of  |
| her life as useless as an appendix and  |
| as lonely as a five-hundred pound       |
| barbell in a steroid-free fitness       |
| center.                                 |
|                                         |
