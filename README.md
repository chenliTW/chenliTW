/ Q: Why is Poland just like the United \
| States? A: In the United States you   |
| can't buy anything for zlotys and in  |
|                                       |
| Poland you can't either, while in the |
| U.S. you can get whatever             |
|                                       |
| you want for dollars, just as you can |
| in Poland.                            |
|                                       |
