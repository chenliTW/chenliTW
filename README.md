/ Q: Why don't Scotsmen ever have coffee \
| the way they like it? A: Well, they    |
| like it with two lumps of sugar. If    |
| they drink                             |
|                                        |
| it at home, they only take one, and if |
| they drink it while                    |
|                                        |
\ visiting, they always take three.      /
