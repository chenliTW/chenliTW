/ The countdown had stalled at 'T' minus  \
| 69 seconds when Desiree, the first      |
| female ape to go up in space, winked at |
| me slyly and pouted her thick, rubbery  |
| lips unmistakably -- the first of many  |
| such advances during what would prove   |
| to be the longest, and most memorable,  |
| space voyage of my career.              |
