/ No live organism can continue for long  \
| to exist sanely under conditions of     |

| katydids are supposed, by some, to      |
| dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by   |
| itself against its hills, holding       |
| darkness within; it had stood so for    |
| eighty years and might stand for eighty |
| more. Within, walls continued upright,  |
| bricks met neatly, floors were firm,    |
| and doors were sensibly shut; silence   |
| lay steadily against the wood and stone |
| of Hill House, and whatever walked      |
| there, walked alone.                    |
|                                         |
