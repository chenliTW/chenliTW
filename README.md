/ In the space of one hundred and         \
| seventy-six years the Mississippi has   |
| shortened itself two hundred and        |
| forty-two miles. Therefore ... in the   |
| Old Silurian Period the Mississippi     |
| River was upward of one million three   |
| hundred thousand miles long ... seven   |
| hundred and forty-two years from now    |
| the Mississippi will be only a mile and |
| three-quarters long. ... There is       |
| something fascinating about science.    |
| One gets such wholesome returns of      |
| conjecture out of such a trifling       |
| investment of fact.                     |
|                                         |
