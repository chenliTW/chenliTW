/  "...The name of the song is called     \
| 'Haddocks' Eyes'!"                      |
|                                         |
| "Oh, that's the name of the song, is    |
| it?" Alice said, trying to feel         |
| interested.                             |
|                                         |
| "No, you don't understand," the Knight  |
| said, looking a little vexed. "That's   |
| what the name is called. The name       |
| really is, 'The Aged Aged Man.'"        |
|                                         |
| "Then I ought to have said "That's what |
| the song is called'?" Alice corrected   |
| herself.                                |
|                                         |
| "No, you oughtn't: that's quite another |
| thing! The song is called 'Ways and     |
| Means': but that's only what it is      |
| called you know!"                       |
|                                         |
| "Well, what is the song then?" said     |
| Alice, who was by this time completely  |
| bewildered.                             |
|                                         |
| "I was coming to that," the Knight      |
| said. "The song really is "A-sitting on |
| a Gate": and the tune's my own          |
| invention."                             |
|                                         |
