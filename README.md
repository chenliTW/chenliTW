/ There is no character, howsoever good   \
| and fine, but it can be destroyed by    |
| ridicule, howsoever poor and witless.   |
| Observe the ass, for instance: his      |
| character is about perfect, he is the   |
| choicest spirit among all the humbler   |
| animals, yet see what ridicule has      |
| brought him to. Instead of feeling      |
| complimented when we are called an ass, |
| we are left in doubt.                   |
|                                         |
