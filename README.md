/ Q: How many journalists does it take to \
| screw in a light bulb? A: Three. One to |

| program to bring                        |
|                                         |
| light to the people, one to report it   |
| as a diabolical government plot         |
|                                         |
| to deprive the poor of darkness, and    |
| one to win a Pulitzer prize for         |
|                                         |
| reporting that Electric Company hired a |
