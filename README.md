/ The bone-chilling scream split the warm \
| summer night in two, the first half     |
| being before the scream when it was     |
| fairly balmy and calm and pleasant, the |
| second half still balmy and quite       |
| pleasant for those who hadn't heard the |
| scream at all, but not calm or balmy or |
| even very nice for those who did hear   |
| the scream, discounting the little      |
| period of time during the actual scream |
| itself when your ears might have been   |
| hearing it but your brain wasn't        |
| reacting yet to let you know.           |
|                                         |
