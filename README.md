/ I reverently believe that the maker who \
| made us all makes everything in New     |
| England, but the weather. I don't know  |
| who makes that, but I think it must be  |
| raw apprentices in the weather-clerks   |
| factory who experiment and learn how,   |
| in New England, for board and clothes,  |
| and then are promoted to make weather   |
| for countries that require a good       |
| article, and will take their custom     |
| elsewhere if they don't get it.         |
