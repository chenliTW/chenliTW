/ The lovely woman-child Kaa was          \
| mercilessly chained to the cruel post   |
| of the warrior-chief Beast, with his    |
| barbarian tribe now stacking wood at    |
| her nubile feet, when the strong clear  |
| voice of the poetic and heroic          |
| Handsomas roared, 'Flick your Bic,      |
| crisp that chick, and you'll feel my    |
| steel through your last meal!'          |
|                                         |
