/  The Priest's grey nimbus in a niche    \
| where he dressed discreetly. I will not |
| sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot  |
| go.                                     |
|                                         |
| A voice, sweetened and sustained,       |
| called to him from the sea. Turning the |
| curve he waved his hand. A sleek brown  |
| head, a seal's, far out on the water,   |
| round. Usurper.                         |
|                                         |
