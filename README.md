/ Unless hours were cups of sack, and    \
| minutes capons, and clocks the tongues |
| of bawds, and dials the signs of       |
| leaping houses, and the blessed sun    |
| himself a fair, hot wench in           |
| flame-colored taffeta, I see no reason |
| why thou shouldst be so superfluous to |
| demand the time of the day. I wasted   |
| time and now doth time waste me.       |
