/ "What's this? Trix? Aunt! Trix? You?    \
| You're after the prize! What is it?" He |
| picked up the box and studied the back. |
| "A glow-in-the-dark squid! Have you got |
| it out of there yet?" He tilted the     |
| box, angling the little colored balls   |
| of cereal so as to see the bottom, and  |
| nearly spilling them onto the table     |
| top. "Here it is!" He hauled out a      |
| little cream-colored, glitter-sprinkled |
| squid, three-inches long and made out   |
| of rubbery plastic.                     |
|                                         |
