/ I will honour Christmas in my heart,    \
| and try to keep it all the year. I will |
| live in the Past, the Present, and the  |
| Future. The Spirits of all Three shall  |
| strive within me. I will not shut out   |
| the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell   |
| me that I may sponge away the writing   |
| on this stone!                          |
|                                         |
